# About Me

I am Nadja Grothe, an enthusiastic, determined and ambitious Full Stack Software Engineer.

I quickly pick up new technologies, concepts, and tools and use those, in combination with previously gained skills, such as my customer/user-focused mindset, to creatively and logically develop efficient solutions.

As a recent graduate of School of Code's intensive 16-week Bootcamp, I am equipped with a solid understanding of a variety of software development approaches, tools, and principals, including agile methodologies, clean code principles, test-driven development and continuous integration and deployment.

Add to that a self-motivated, passionate and energetic personality, a supportive, fun and empathetic teamwork mentality, along with a hunger for personal development, learning, overcoming challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone, and you will begin to get a sense of who I am.

Beyond software engineering, I have a wide range of hobbies and interests. I own a rescue dog named Chutney, which is always a great reason to spend some time in nature. Reading, dancing, listening to podcasts and music, doing DIY projects and having good conversations, are some of my favourite ways to spend my time. Plus I enjoy some friendly competition while playing games (both board and video games), and the occasional high adrenaline activity such as bungee jumping, skydiving, or paragliding sprinkled in.
